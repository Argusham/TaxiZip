# ðŸš– **Taxi dApp - Decentralized Payment System** ðŸš–

## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Taxi dApp**, a decentralized application designed to revolutionize contactless payments in the taxi industry. Leveraging the power of the **Celo blockchain** and is built using **Next.js** and **Yarn**. This app ensures secure, fast, and efficient transactions between commuters and drivers through QR code technology.

---

### **Project Highlights**

- **Blockchain**: Built on **Celo** to ensure secure, decentralized payments.
- **Smart Contracts**: Contracts deployed on Celo's Alfajores testnet, handling transactions and incentives.
- **Incentives**: Users are rewarded with **0.2 cUSD** after interacting with 2 unique users.
- **QR Code Payments**: Fast and convenient payments using QR code technology.
- **Data Visualization**: Payment and incentive data are fetched and displayed using **The Graph**.

### Key Components:
- **Drivers and Commuters**: Engage in transactions via QR codes.
- **Smart Contract**: Handles payments, tracks interactions, and awards incentives.
- **Incentive Pool**: Funded by a 1% transaction fee to reward users.
- **Celo Blockchain & cUSD**: Provides the decentralized platform and stable currency.

### Process Steps:
1. Driver sets the fare and generates a QR code.
2. Commuter scans the QR code to initiate payment.
3. Smart Contract processes the payment:
   - Transfers cUSD (minus 1% tax) to the driver's wallet.
   - Allocates 1% tax to the incentive pool.
4. Smart Contract updates user interactions and checks for incentive eligibility.
5. Incentives are awarded if eligibility criteria are met.

### Data Movement:
1. Commuter obtains payment info by scanning the QR code.
2. Payment Information is sent to the Smart Contract.
3. Smart Contract verifies balances, processes payment, and updates user data.
4. Incentive Pool collects taxes and funds incentives.
5. Users receive incentives after qualifying interactions.
