# ðŸš– **Taxi dApp - Decentralized Payment System** ðŸš–

## **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Taxi dApp**, a decentralized application for seamless contactless payments in the taxi industry. This project leverages the **Celo blockchain** and is built using **Next.js** and **Yarn**. The app allows commuters to easily pay taxi drivers using QR codes, making the payment process fast and efficient.

### **Project Highlights**

- **Blockchain**: Built on **Celo** to ensure secure, decentralized payments.
- **Smart Contracts**: Contracts deployed on Celo's Alfajores testnet, handling transactions and incentives.
- **Incentives**: Users are rewarded with **0.2 cUSD** after interacting with 2 unique users.
- **QR Code Payments**: Fast and convenient payments using QR code technology.
- **Data Visualization**: Payment and incentive data are fetched and displayed using **The Graph**.
